We at HueHello understand this pain point quite well and we are trying our best
to come up with ideas so you can enjoy your Philips hue lights with ease and it
becomes more fun for you. Introducing “**Group Remote**” smart notification.

With one notification, you can control your complete Home. You can change the
group, turn on and off the group, increase or decrease the brightness. You can
change various lights shades from moods and yes you can enter into the app.
