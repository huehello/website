> *Imagine two scenarios; Scenario 1: You are in bed and you turn off lights and
> they go instant off leaving you in sudden dark. Scenario 2: You are in bed and
you order lights to fade-out and turn off in 15, 20 minutes and they gradually
fade to off. Which scenario sounds comfort?*

We at HueHello believe in users satisfaction. If you have a use case, we are
here to solve it. Recently we received a request from one of our user to allow
lights to fade-in OR fade-out than instant off.

She wanted to set the light brightness to 20% and turn off lights in 15 minutes
gradually so she can goto bed. She mentioned to fade-in lights to turn on so her
children can wake up slowly with light and feel fresh.

Our solution: Group fader, we added a simple to operate feature which you can
start on one tap. Not only that, it is smart enough to preserve your last
settings so you donâ€™t need to pick your scene and timing every time. Here is
quick video explainer.
