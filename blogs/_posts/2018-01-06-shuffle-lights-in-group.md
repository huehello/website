### Scene

A scene is a collection of lights set in different colours and brightness which
offers you a pleasant aura in your home. Let us show you one image:

you can set a scene in your living room and make it come alive. Setting a scene
is very easy on hue hello, Here we will show you how to set a scene and how to
use shuffle feature.

### Shuffle Scene

Shuffle scene offers you unlimited possibilities. Let us explain with an
example.

> Suppose you have a group with **3 lights**.<br> &<br> You set a scene which has
> **8 shades** (colour and brightness)

Because you have 3 lights, you can get maximum 3 shades in normal scene.
Interesting part is shuffle of a scene. Everytime you tap on shuffle icon. You
shuffle all shades. For randomly 3 shades will be chosen for your 3 lights.
Mathematically, you can get 336 shades with 3 lights.

For 1st light, we have 8 options and we will choose 1 randomly.<br> For 2nd
light, we have 7 options and we will choose 1 randomly.<br> For 3rd light, we
have 6 options and we will choose 1 randomly.

### 8 * 7 * 6 == 336

This is how shuffle scene is one of the unique and best feature of HueHello.
Here is a short video of 30 seconds on how to use shuffle feature.
