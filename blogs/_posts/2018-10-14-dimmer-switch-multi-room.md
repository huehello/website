Many users were asking for something simple yet powerful to set it up. We
redesigned the whole setup process in a very simple way. We are sure, you will
like it.

Here are highlights of new feature:

* You can set up one dimmer switch and control multiple rooms/groups
* You can setup button by button and control the way you want it
* You can set up long click action separately and use it for critical use cases
like turning on-off home OR blinking
* It is damn easy like anything else we do
* Here is a quick video to explain the dimmer switch setup, Enjoy:
