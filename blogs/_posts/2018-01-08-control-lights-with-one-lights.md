*Lights have become smart and Philips hue is leader in smart lights. We at
HueHello thought to make it fun and easy for you.*

Our users told us they want a simple way to switch off all lights. They told us
a simple use case of switching all lights before going to bed. We implemented a
simple one tap solution to do same.

> You can switch on or off your complete home with one tap. Use it before you goto
> bed or whenever you need it.

Here is a quick 10 seconds video for same.
