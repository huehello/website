One key point from the book is Habit is three step loop. **A cue**, An
**action** followed by **Result**. I own Philips Hue lights and I thought to
experiment to cultivate Habit loop so my children can sleep on time.

> Remember, It is not a magic wind. Habits take time to settle.

I used ‘[Hue
Hello](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prodpeak.huehello)’ app
with my ‘Philips Hue’ lights. There is a [Multiple Schedule](/blogs/huehello/multiple-schedule-alarm-hue-lights/) feature in app.

I created 3 schedules under multi schedule and named it Children sleep time. It
is very easy to create and set.

**Schedule 1**. Trigger at 9:30 PM, Start animated scene in Living room and Kids
room and blink lights with rainbow scene and 50% brightness. This served as Cue
and I told my children every-time light blinks at this time, it means this is
their bed time.

**Schedule 2**. Trigger at 9:32 PM, Set a soothing cold white shade (Hue Hello
has preset moods). This serves as cue they have to goto bed now. Children take
**action **and goto bed.

**Schedule 3**. Trigger at 9:35 PM. Set a low brightness scene and fade out in
15 minutes so lights can turn off before they fly in dream world. The **result**
is **children going to sleep** and fading of light ensures a good sleep.

> If you try this technique OR use multi schedule for some other use case, share with others.
